# Napoleon AI Local Memory

## Current Session Context
- **Lead Engineer Role**: Managing comprehensive Napoleon AI setup and bootstrapping
- **Active Enhancement Layer**: Ultimate Napoleon AI Enhancement Layer
- **Session Focus**: Repository initialization, MCP server activation, subagent orchestration

## Local Development State
- **Repository Status**: Clean main branch, production-ready MVP deployed
- **Environment**: macOS Darwin 24.4.0
- **Working Directory**: /Users/henryvantieghem/NapoleonAI

## Quick Memory Notes
- Color scheme updated: Dark navy `#1B2951` and gold `#D4AF37` (replacing original burgundy)
- Authentication: Using Clerk instead of Supabase Auth
- Database: Simplified MVP schema with Supabase backend
- AI Pipeline: OpenAI GPT-4 with keyword-based fallbacks

## Active Task Checkpoints
- ✅ Repository initialization complete with updated CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Three-tier memory architecture established
- ✅ MCP server framework activated (available: github-repo, terminal-commands, git-commands, sequential-thinking, code-runner)
- ✅ Subagent orchestration implemented with OODA loop
- ✅ Documentation research completed (React 18+, Clerk, Next.js 14)
- ✅ Memory architecture updated with modular @import system
- ✅ Vercel AI Cloud environment setup completed
- ✅ Custom hooks framework documented
- ⏳ Figma design integration pending (MCP server not available)

## Bootstrap Completion Summary
1. ✅ Repository scanned and memory architecture established
2. ✅ Parallel research agents deployed successfully
3. ✅ OODA loop implemented for adaptive task execution
4. ✅ Custom hooks framework documented and ready for implementation
5. ✅ Executive-grade environment setup completed

## Technical Context
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase with RLS enabled
- **Authentication**: Clerk with OAuth providers
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions

## Session Memory Patterns
- Using checkpoint pattern for decision persistence
- Leveraging quick memory for critical requirements
- Implementing @import statements for modular memory files
