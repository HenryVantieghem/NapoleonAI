- **Features**:
  - Automatic backup creation with timestamps
  - Duplicate section removal and content optimization
  - Memory usage reporting and cleanup of old backups
  - Smart compaction that preserves essential information
- **Usage**: `npm run memory:compact` or `./scripts/memory-optimizer.sh compact`

### ‚úÖ 2. Self-Healing CI with Enhanced Lighthouse
**Location**: `/scripts/deploy-and-verify.sh` (Enhanced)
- **Features**:
  - Stricter thresholds: Performance ‚â•92%, Accessibility ‚â•92%, Best-Practices ‚â•95%
  - Auto-correction for common performance and accessibility issues
  - Automatic commit of fixes with `chore(ci): auto-heal` messages
  - Enhanced performance reporting with executive context

- **Bundle analyzer**: Integrated with `ANALYZE=true npm run build`
- **Automatic optimization**: Dynamic imports and tree shaking recommendations
- **Real-time monitoring**: Bundle size checks in CI pipeline

### ‚úÖ 4. Image Optimizer
**Location**: `/scripts/optimize-images.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Converts images to AVIF (primary) + WebP (fallback) + PNG (legacy)
  - Generates responsive sizes: 640w, 828w, 1200w, 1920w
  - Creates Next.js Image component usage templates
  - Quality settings optimized for executive experience (AVIF 80%, WebP 85%)
  - Automatic component generation with blur placeholders
- **Usage**: `npm run optimize:images`

### ‚úÖ 5. Pre-Push Git Hooks
**Location**: `.githooks/pre-push` + `/scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`
- **Quality gates**:
  - TypeScript type checking
  - ESLint with auto-fix
  - Unit and integration test execution
  - Build verification and bundle size checks
  - RLS policy validation
  - Sensitive data detection
  - Commit message format validation
- **Installation**: `npm run install-hooks`

### ‚úÖ 6. Logging Infrastructure (Sentry + Segment)
**Locations**: 
- `/src/lib/monitoring/sentry.ts` - Error tracking
- `/src/lib/monitoring/segment.ts` - Analytics
- `/src/lib/monitoring/index.ts` - Unified interface

**Features**:
- **Executive-grade privacy**: Sanitized error reporting, no PII exposure
- **Performance monitoring**: 3-second executive rule enforcement  
- **ROI tracking**: Time savings and efficiency metrics
- **Journey analytics**: Onboarding ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí Adoption ‚Üí Mastery
- **Critical alerts**: Immediate notification for executive-impacting issues
- **Session management**: Full executive session lifecycle tracking

### ‚úÖ 7. RLS Guard (Integrated in Pre-Push Hook)
**Features**:
- Automatic detection of database migrations without RLS policies
- Blocks commits that create tables without Row Level Security
- Validates existing RLS policy coverage
- Executive data protection compliance

## üöÄ New NPM Scripts

```bash
# Super-Agent Commands
