CREATE TABLE conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT,
  participants TEXT[],
  platforms TEXT[],
  last_activity TIMESTAMP,
  priority_score INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE integrations_health (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id),
  platform TEXT,
  status TEXT,
  last_sync TIMESTAMP,
  error_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  metrics JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE ai_insights (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id UUID REFERENCES messages(id),
  insight_type TEXT,
  confidence_score DECIMAL,
  insight_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
