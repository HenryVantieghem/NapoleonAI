## Integration with Development Workflow

### VS Code Integration
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
      "source.organizeImports": true
    },
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
name: Executive Quality Gates
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Executive Code Standards
        run: npm run luxury-lint
      - name: Performance Validation
        run: npm run performance-check

        run: npm run security-scan
```

## Hook Implementation Strategy

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with notification hooks, add enforcement gradually
2. **Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand luxury standards
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Refine hooks based on executive feedback
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track hook impact on development velocity

## Executive Success Metrics

- **Code Quality Score**: Maintain 95%+ quality rating
- **Performance SLA**: Meet all executive performance targets
- **Security Compliance**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Development Velocity**: Hooks improve rather than hinder productivity

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Code Review**: Integrate with Claude for intelligent suggestions
- **Luxury Design Validation**: Automated design system compliance checking
- **Executive Feedback Integration**: Direct hooks to executive testing feedback
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Live SLA tracking during development

This hooks configuration ensures Napoleon AI maintains the luxury quality standards expected by C-suite executives while enabling productive development workflows.
