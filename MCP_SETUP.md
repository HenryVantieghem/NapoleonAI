# Napoleon AI - MCP Server Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server setup for Napoleon AI, optimized for luxury executive productivity platform development.

## Configured MCP Servers

### Core Development Servers
1. **GitHub Repository (`github-repo`)**
   - Command: `github-repo-mcp`
   - Purpose: Repository integration, PR management, issue tracking
   - Ideal for: Code reviews, project management, collaboration

2. **Git Commands (`git-commands`)**
   - Command: `mcp-git`
   - Purpose: Advanced Git operations through MCP
   - Ideal for: Version control, branching, merging

3. **Terminal Commands (`terminal-commands`)**
   - Command: `mcp-server-commands`
   - Purpose: Execute shell commands safely
   - Ideal for: Build processes, deployment, system operations

4. **File System (`filesystem`)**
   - Command: `mcp-server-filesystem`
   - Purpose: Direct file and directory operations
   - Ideal for: Project structure management, file manipulation

### Productivity & Automation Servers
5. **Code Runner (`code-runner`)**
   - Command: `mcp-server-code-runner`
   - Purpose: Execute code snippets and scripts
   - Ideal for: Testing, prototyping, code validation

6. **Sequential Thinking (`sequential-thinking`)**
   - Command: `mcp-server-sequential-thinking`
   - Purpose: Structured problem-solving and planning
   - Ideal for: Complex feature planning, architectural decisions

### Cloud & Platform Integration
7. **Supabase (`supabase`)**
   - Command: `mcp-server-supabase`
   - Purpose: Database operations, authentication, real-time features
   - Ideal for: Backend development, data management

8. **Vercel (`vercel`)**
   - Command: `@mistertk/vercel-mcp`
   - Purpose: Deployment, domain management, monitoring
   - Features: 114+ tools, 4 resources, 5 prompts
   - Ideal for: Frontend deployment, performance optimization

### Testing & Browser Automation
9. **Playwright (`playwright`)**
   - Command: `@playwright/mcp`
   - Purpose: Browser automation, E2E testing
   - Ideal for: UI testing, web scraping, automation

## Optimization for Napoleon AI Development

### Executive Productivity Focus
- **Sequential Thinking**: Use for high-level feature planning and executive decision frameworks
- **Code Runner**: Rapid prototyping of productivity algorithms
- **Supabase**: Secure executive data storage and real-time collaboration

### Luxury Platform Requirements
- **Vercel**: Premium hosting with global CDN for executive-grade performance
- **Playwright**: Automated testing ensuring flawless user experience
- **GitHub**: Professional development workflow with advanced collaboration

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Use Sequential Thinking for feature architecture
2. **Development**: File System + Code Runner for rapid iteration
3. **Version Control**: Git Commands for professional workflow
4. **Database**: Supabase for secure, scalable backend
5. **Deployment**: Vercel for premium hosting and monitoring
6. **Testing**: Playwright for comprehensive E2E validation

## Usage Commands

### List all configured servers:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

### Add new server:
```bash
claude mcp add <name> <command>
```

### Remove server:
```bash
claude mcp remove <name>
```

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Installed:
- Node.js v20.19.3
- npm with global packages
- Claude CLI
- Puppeteer & Playwright for browser automation

### Global MCP Packages:
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase`
- `mcp-server-code-runner`
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking`
- `@mistertk/vercel-mcp`
- `@playwright/mcp`

## Security Considerations
- All MCP servers run with local scope for Napoleon AI project
- Supabase configured for read-only mode by default
- Vercel integration requires API token authentication
- GitHub integration uses secure OAuth flow

## Next Steps
1. Configure environment variables for Supabase/Vercel
2. Set up authentication tokens for cloud services
3. Test integration with Napoleon AI development workflow
4. Optimize server configuration based on usage patterns
